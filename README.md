## Outline
The purpose of this repository is to hold the documentation required to build my final year project. The [Planning](https://github.com/JavaTheNutt/spendlyte_reports/) directory holds the documentation and diagrams that were generated during the initial planning phase of building this application, while the [Implementation](https://github.com/JavaTheNutt/spendlyte_reports) directory holds the documentation generated while actually building the application.
